# 2048GAME
### Gameplay

You can move the tiles in four directions using the arrow keys: up(C), down(B), left(E), and right(D). All numbers on the board will slide into that direction until they hit the wall and if they bump into each other then two numbers will be combined into one if they have the same value. Each number will only be combined once per move. Every move a new number 2 or 4 appears. If you have a 2048 on the board you have won, but you lose once the board is full and you cannot make a move. 

You can also insert a txt file that contains a grid and the following plays and it will play itself
